TextReplace Plugin Installation Instructions
============================================

To use the TextReplace plugin (recommended for UTF-16 file handling):

1. Download TextReplace plugin v1.5 from:
   https://nsis.sourceforge.io/TextReplace_plugin

2. Extract the ZIP file

3. Copy files:
   - TextReplace.dll → C:\BlackFishOffcier\Needed to compile installer\Plugins\
   - TextReplace.nsh → C:\BlackFishOffcier\Needed to compile installer\Plugins\

4. The installer will automatically detect and use the plugin if these files are present.

Benefits:
- Proper UTF-16 encoding support (no corruption)
- No PowerShell dependency
- Faster and more reliable
- Reduces antivirus false positives

If the plugin is not installed, the installer will fall back to a PowerShell-based
method that also handles UTF-16 correctly.
