BlackFish Officer Better Officer/Sergent Orders

**Script Description**
You will never need to open the officer menu again. This script allows you to activate officer orders with a single key press via macros. You will never get killed because you forgot to close the officer menu, this also allows you attack, block, and switch weapons to automatically cancel an order. Fire at will is automatically enabled when placing a line. AGS didn't let us bind orders to keys, SO I DID IT ANYWAY. forsen8Baseg
